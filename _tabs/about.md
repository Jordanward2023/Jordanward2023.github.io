Hello everyone! I first want to thank you all for taking the time to visit my page today. This will be a fun, semi-formal space where I share topics that interest me, primarily revolving around IT and aspects of cybersecurity. However, I also enjoy voicing my opinion on a variety of topics. Given my background in security, I feel obligated to tell you that I **will not**  be stealing any information from you. This site is hosted by GitHub Pages and adheres to all their policies and compliance laws.

## So... Who am I??

You likely had to type in my name to find this page, so I'll skip the usual "My name is" introduction. I am currently a junior at Grand Canyon University, studying cybersecurity—quite fitting for this site, right? I plan to graduate in December 2025. Currently, I work as a Network Technician at Grand Canyon Education, a shared service provider for many universities across the United States. Before this role, I had the pleasure of working as an IT Analyst for a year, also with GCE. 

I am what people refer to as a "people person." I enjoy engaging in conversations on any level, whether it's a heated debate or casual chat about how Michael Jackson was the greatest. If I’ve sparked your interest, feel free to reach out via email or any digital platform linked below. I'm diligent about checking my business socials. That’s essentially the purpose of this blog—engaging with you! Let me know if you have any topics you'd like me to cover in a blog post or YouTube video.
