You may be considering a career in IT or transitioning into IT from a different field. Everyone has their own reasons for the career choices they make. Today, I will provide an overview of IT and discuss some common and genuine reasons why it captures our interest. 


## What is IT?

IT is commonly used as an abbreviation for Information Technology. Now that we know that, I can confidently say "IT" and know you understand. IT is simply the study and application of technology. Furthermore, IT refers to use of computers, networks, and other forms of tech to store, manage, retrieve, process, and transmit data in a multitude of forms. This is a broad field that will encompass a wide range of technical activities such as managing computer systems and networks to maintaining and manipulating software applications, ensuring cybersecurity and also providing technical support to users or even organizations. You will more than likely see this exact definition on my soon to come post about IT as a whole.


## Isn't IT Just Computer Science?

IT is often considered to be under the broader umbrella of computer science, which is correct. So, lets go ahead and break this down a little further. 

- **Computer Science:** CS has a primary focus of the theory and algrithms behind computing systems. This includes, but not limited to:
	- Software Development
	- Design of Syntax and Programming Languages
	- Database Architecture
	- Cryptographic Algorithms
	- Artificial Intelligence
	- Operating Systems 
	
- **Information Technology:** IT on the other hand, will have its dominent focus on the management, integration, and support of the technology to gain leverage on business issues and use that levereage to make the task at hand more **efficent**, which you will find to be the key objective of most IT Operations in a business standard. This will consist of, but again not limited to:
	- System Administration
	- Network Administation
	- Database management
	- Business Managed Services
	- Cybersecurity
	- Cloud Computing / Virtualization
	
However, there are numerous instances where there is significant crossover between Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT). Just because a topic falls under the CS umbrella doesn't exclude its relevance to both fields. For instance, tasks such as database structuring, algorithms, and architecture will certainly be carried out by a CS team or individual. However, the job does not stop there. An IT administrator, often a database administrator, is crucial for overseeing the implementation and ongoing management of the database. Depending on the scale, this could be a single-person job or require a team of data analysts to manipulate data and maintain the database effectively and **efficiently**.

Hopefully, the differences between the two fields have become clear for you to understand. This insight stems from my own experience and research, so feel free to delve deeper to explore the technical distinctions between them.	

## Should I Pursue a Career in IT?

Now, the intriguing part of this article: Is IT the right fit for you? People pursue various careers for countless reasons, which are entirely personal, so I am not here to judge. However, it's essential to be realistic about whether this field aligns with your goals. These insights are based on my own perspective and observations of numerous individuals. Below are motivations and pitfalls ***I*** believe individuals often consider when contemplating a career in IT:

- **Motivations to Pursue IT:**
	- Passion for Technology
	- Job Security
	- Natural Aptitude
	- Career Opportunities
	- Innovative Mind
	- Problem-Solving

- **Ulterior Motive's to Pursuing IT Career:**
	- Sole focus on **Monetary Gain**
	- Preference for Hands-on Work
	- Reliance on Hearsay
	- Influence from Social Media
	
These are valid points regarding why people choose IT as a field. I've highlighted monetary gain because a significant number of people I meet pursuing this field talk about the money they expect to make or cite it as their primary motivation. Let me be clear: if your sole purpose for pursuing IT, or any STEM field for that matter, is monetary gain, you are unlikely to see it through. These tech jobs are demanding and require genuine technical skills to handle day-to-day tasks effectively. It's essential to have a genuine interest in technology if you want to succeed in this field, as the tech world evolves rapidly every day. I hope this article helps you decide whether to join this field with the confidence that you will succeed.

## Conclusion

Choosing a career in IT involves understaing what IT is, at least at a surface-scratching level. This also requires careful consideration of personal motivations and career aspirations. It is essential to recognize the challenges of the profession, which require ongoing skill development and an innovative mind to adapt to the advancements of technology everyday.

Ultimately, the decision to enter the field of IT should align with your long-term goals and interests. By understanding the nuances between IT and related fields, you can make an informed choice that sets you on a path to success in a dynamic and evolving industry.

I trust this article has provided valuable insights to help you navigate your decision-making process effectively. Thank you for reading!
